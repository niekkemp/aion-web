    challenge: `Traditional streaming requires continuous connectivity that airlines cannot guarantee. 
              Licensing restrictions often prevent premium content from being shown without approved DRM solutions.`,
    solution: `AION Media Group equips aircraft with portable onboard servers and branded VOD applications 
             that deliver Hollywood-approved content offline. 
             Our encoding technology, including Titan Aegis, reduces file sizes by up to 70 percent, 
             cutting network costs for content updates. Fleet-wide provisioning is automated, enabling same-day content delivery.`,
    value: `Airlines improve passenger experience, reduce operational costs and meet studio compliance requirements 
          with a scalable and future-proof inflight platform.`,
