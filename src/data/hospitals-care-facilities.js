    challenge: `Hospitals often operate with limited connectivity or strict IT security rules that block cloud-based media platforms. 
              Patient-facing systems need to be simple and distraction-free, 
              while staff training requires data privacy and access control.`,
    solution: `AION Media Group delivers secure VOD applications and set-top boxes designed for care environments. 
             Patients access entertainment libraries through simple interfaces, 
             while staff use the same infrastructure for training modules. 
             The CMS allows administrators to schedule, control visibility and track usage, all within compliance frameworks.`,
    value: `Hospitals reduce patient boredom, increase staff engagement and meet compliance standards â€” 
          all within one platform that respects privacy and works even under IT restrictions.`,
