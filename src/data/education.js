    challenge: `Many e-learning tools lack offline capabilities, advanced analytics or proper rights management. 
              This limits their effectiveness in low-connectivity regions and makes them unsuitable for premium content.`,
    solution: `AION Media Group delivers education-ready VOD platforms with built-in analytics. 
             Teachers and administrators track engagement, device usage and points of drop-off. 
             Students can access materials offline, ensuring learning continues everywhere. 
             DRM ensures secure handling of licensed educational content.`,
    value: `Institutions gain better insights into learning progress, 
          reach students even without stable internet and build trusted platforms 
          that scale from classrooms to entire school systems.`,
