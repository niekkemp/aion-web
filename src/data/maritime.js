             Content is synchronized in port and made available on board through portable servers and branded VOD apps. 
             DRM ensures Hollywood compliance, while lightweight hardware guarantees uninterrupted playback even far from shore.`,
    value: `Maritime operators can deliver premium media experiences to crew and passengers without incurring satellite bandwidth costs, 
          boosting satisfaction and operational efficiency.`,
